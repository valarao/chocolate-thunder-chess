# Image Generator

## Overview
Script that takes in a folder of `.pgn` files and generates `.png` images.

This can be used for creating images for mock data on the front end.

## Instructions
1. Use command line to `cd` into the `image-generator` folder
2. Add `.pgn` files with positions into the `/pgn` folder
3. Run `node imageGenerator.js`

## Future Work
In the future, we will convert this script into a backend endpoint.
